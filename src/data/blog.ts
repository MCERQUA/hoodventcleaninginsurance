        <h2>Quick Answer: What is NFPA 96?</h2>
        <p><strong>NFPA 96</strong> is the National Fire Protection Association standard for "Ventilation Control and Fire Protection of Commercial Cooking Operations." It establishes minimum fire safety requirements for commercial kitchen exhaust systems, including cleaning frequencies, inspection requirements, and contractor qualifications. Hood cleaning contractors must understand and follow NFPA 96 to maintain valid insurance coverage and avoid liability for kitchen fires.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Understanding NFPA 96: The Standard Every Hood Cleaner Must Know</h2>

      <img src="/images/blog/nfpa-inspection.png" alt="Fire safety inspector examining commercial kitchen exhaust hood system during NFPA 96 compliance inspection" class="blog-image" />
      <p class="blog-image-caption">A fire safety inspector conducts an NFPA 96 compliance inspection of a commercial kitchen exhaust system.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/nfpa-96-standard-development/96" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NFPA 96 Standard</a> is the foundation of commercial kitchen fire safety in the United States. Originally published in 1961, it has been continuously updated to reflect modern cooking practices and equipment.</p>

      <p>For hood vent cleaning contractors, NFPA 96 isn't just a guideline—it's the legal standard in most jurisdictions. Fire marshals, insurance companies, and property managers all reference NFPA 96 when evaluating whether a commercial kitchen exhaust system has been properly maintained.</p>

      <p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="/hood-cleaning-compliance-insurance">Hood Cleaning Insurance Coverage</a> that meets NFPA 96 requirements.</p>

      <h2>NFPA 96 Cleaning Frequency Requirements</h2>
      <p>One of the most critical aspects of NFPA 96 is the cleaning frequency schedule. Section 11.4 establishes minimum cleaning intervals based on cooking volume and type:</p>

      <h3>Monthly Cleaning Required:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>High-volume cooking operations (24-hour kitchens)</li>
        <li>Solid fuel cooking (wood, charcoal, mesquite)</li>
        <li>High-grease production (wok cooking, char-broiling)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Quarterly Cleaning Required:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Moderate-volume cooking operations</li>
        <li>Most full-service restaurants</li>
        <li>Hotel and hospital kitchens</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Semi-Annual Cleaning Required:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Low-volume cooking operations</li>
        <li>Churches, senior centers, seasonal facilities</li>
        <li>Day camps and youth facilities</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Annual Cleaning Required:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Low-grease cooking operations</li>
        <li>Pizza ovens (gas-fired, no solid fuel)</li>
        <li>Steam-only operations</li>
      </ul>

      <p>These are <strong>minimum</strong> requirements. The <a href="https://www.ikeca.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">International Kitchen Exhaust Cleaning Association (IKECA)</a> recommends that contractors always inspect systems first and recommend more frequent cleaning when grease buildup warrants it.</p>

      <h2>Documentation Requirements Under NFPA 96</h2>
      <p>Section 11.6.1 requires that hood cleaning contractors provide detailed documentation after each service. This documentation protects both you and your client in the event of a fire investigation.</p>

      <p>Required documentation includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Date of inspection/cleaning</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Name of servicing company and technician</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Areas cleaned</strong> (hood, ducts, fans, etc.)</li>
        <li><strong>Areas not cleaned</strong> with explanation</li>
        <li><strong>Observations</strong> of grease buildup or system deficiencies</li>
        <li><strong>Before and after photographs</strong> (industry best practice)</li>
        <li><strong>Recommendations</strong> for repairs or more frequent cleaning</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This documentation is critical for your <a href="/hood-cleaning-compliance-insurance">completed operations coverage</a>. If a fire occurs after your service, your cleaning report and photos provide evidence that you performed work to standard.</p>

      <h2>Access Requirements for Cleaning</h2>
      <p>NFPA 96 Section 11.2.1 requires that exhaust systems be designed with adequate access for cleaning and inspection. However, many older systems lack proper access panels.</p>

      <p>As a contractor, you should:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Document any areas that cannot be accessed for cleaning</li>
        <li>Recommend installation of access panels where needed</li>
        <li>Never sign off that a system is "clean" if you couldn't access all areas</li>
        <li>Include access limitations in your service report</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Insurance Implications of NFPA 96 Non-Compliance</h2>

      <img src="/images/blog/grease-buildup-hazard.png" alt="Heavy grease buildup inside commercial kitchen exhaust duct showing fire hazard conditions" class="blog-image" />
      <p class="blog-image-caption">Dangerous grease accumulation in a commercial exhaust duct—a fire investigation will examine whether cleaning intervals met NFPA 96 requirements.</p>

      <p>Here's where NFPA 96 directly impacts your business: if a fire occurs and the investigation reveals the exhaust system was not maintained according to NFPA 96 standards, the restaurant's insurance company will look for someone to blame.</p>

      <p>Common scenarios that lead to contractor liability:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Inadequate cleaning:</strong> Grease left in ducts or fans</li>
        <li><strong>Improper documentation:</strong> No proof of work performed</li>
        <li><strong>Missed cleaning intervals:</strong> System not serviced at NFPA-required frequency</li>
        <li><strong>Failure to report deficiencies:</strong> Not documenting system problems</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This is why <a href="/hood-cleaning-compliance-insurance">specialized hood cleaning insurance</a> with proper completed operations coverage is essential. Standard general liability policies often exclude claims related to fire or professional services.</p>

      <h2>NFPA 96 and Fire Suppression Systems</h2>
      <p>NFPA 96 also covers requirements for fire suppression systems in commercial kitchens. While hood cleaners may not service these systems, you should understand the requirements:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Suppression systems must be inspected every 6 months</li>
        <li>Fusible links must be replaced after each activation or cleaning</li>
        <li>Systems must be serviced by certified technicians</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/nfpa-17a-standard-development/17a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NFPA 17A Standard</a> covers wet chemical suppression systems specifically, and many hood cleaning contractors also hold certifications to service these systems.</p>

      <h2>Getting Certified: IKECA and Other Credentials</h2>
      <p>While NFPA 96 doesn't require contractor certification, having industry credentials demonstrates professionalism and can help you win contracts and reduce insurance premiums.</p>

      <p>Recommended certifications include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="https://www.ikeca.org/certification" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKECA Certification</a>:</strong> The gold standard for kitchen exhaust cleaners</li>
        <li><strong>NFPA 96 Training:</strong> Available through various providers</li>

    slug: "why-general-liability-is-not-enough",
    excerpt: "Standard general liability policies exclude critical risks for hood cleaning contractors including pollution, fire claims, and professional liability. Learn what coverage you actually need.",
    content: `
      <div class="snippet-box">
        <h2>Quick Answer: What Insurance Do Hood Cleaners Need?</h2>
        <p>Hood cleaning contractors need more than standard general liability insurance. Required coverages include: <strong>General Liability with Completed Operations</strong>, <strong>Contractors Pollution Liability (CPL)</strong>, <strong>Professional Liability/E&O</strong>, and <strong>Care, Custody & Control coverage</strong>. Standard GL policies exclude pollution and professional services, leaving hood cleaners dangerously exposed to their biggest risks.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>The Hidden Exclusions in Standard General Liability Policies</h2>

      <img src="/images/blog/claim-denied.png" alt="Insurance claim documents stamped DENIED on office desk" class="blog-image" />
      <p class="blog-image-caption">Many hood cleaning contractors discover their policy exclusions only when a claim is denied.</p>

      <p>When most hood vent cleaning contractors first start their business, they do the right thing: they buy insurance. Unfortunately, they often buy the wrong insurance—a standard general liability policy from a local agent who doesn't understand the hood cleaning industry.</p>

      <p>Standard GL policies contain exclusions that specifically deny coverage for the most common claims hood cleaners face:</p>

      <h3>The Pollution Exclusion</h3>
      <p>Nearly every standard general liability policy contains an "absolute pollution exclusion" that denies coverage for any pollution-related claim. For hood cleaners, this exclusion is devastating.</p>

      <p>Claims denied under pollution exclusions include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Grease runoff entering a storm drain during pressure washing</li>
        <li>Cleaning chemicals causing respiratory issues for restaurant staff</li>
        <li>Degreaser damaging kitchen equipment or finishes</li>
        <li>Grease contaminating adjacent properties</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater-discharges-commercial-and-light-industrial-facilities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EPA regulates stormwater discharges</a>, and violators can face significant fines. Without pollution liability coverage, you're paying those fines and cleanup costs out of pocket.</p>

      <img src="/images/blog/pollution-liability.png" alt="Storm drain contamination scene with caution tape and grease runoff in commercial parking lot" class="blog-image" />
      <p class="blog-image-caption">Grease contamination in storm drains can result in EPA fines of $25,000 or more—and standard GL won't cover it.</p>

      <p><strong>Solution:</strong> <a href="/grease-trap-liability-coverage">Contractors Pollution Liability (CPL)</a> coverage specifically designed for hood cleaning operations.</p>

      <h3>The Professional Services Exclusion</h3>
      <p>Standard GL excludes claims arising from "professional services," which includes inspection reports and certifications. If you provide:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cleaning compliance certificates</li>
        <li>Inspection reports</li>
        <li>NFPA 96 compliance documentation</li>
        <li>Recommendations for cleaning frequency</li>
      </ul>

      <p>...and a claim arises from an alleged error in those services, your standard GL policy will deny it.</p>

      <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Professional Liability (Errors & Omissions) coverage for inspection and certification services.</p>

      <h3>The Care, Custody & Control Exclusion</h3>
      <p>Standard policies exclude damage to property "in your care, custody, or control." When you're cleaning a commercial kitchen exhaust system, you have temporary custody of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hood canopies and filters</li>
        <li>Exhaust fans and motors</li>
        <li>Ductwork and access panels</li>
        <li>Fire suppression links and nozzles</li>
        <li>Rooftop equipment you access for cleaning</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you accidentally damage a $15,000 exhaust fan motor or trigger a fire suppression system discharge, standard GL won't cover it.</p>

      <p><strong>Solution:</strong> <a href="/hood-cleaning-compliance-insurance">Specialized hood cleaning insurance</a> with Care, Custody & Control coverage extensions.</p>

      <h2>The Completed Operations Problem</h2>
      <p>This is the biggest coverage gap for hood cleaners. "Completed operations" coverage protects you from claims arising <strong>after</strong> you've left the job site.</p>

      <p>Scenario: You clean a restaurant's hood system on Monday. On Friday, a grease fire breaks out and causes $500,000 in damage. The restaurant's insurance company investigates and alleges your cleaning was inadequate.</p>

      <p>Standard GL policies often:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Exclude completed operations entirely</li>
        <li>Have very low sub-limits for completed operations</li>
        <li>Exclude fire-related claims specifically</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Without proper completed operations coverage, you're defending that $500,000 claim with your personal assets.</p>

      <p class="blog-image-caption">A grease fire can cause hundreds of thousands in damage—and insurance companies will investigate whether cleaning was adequate.</p>

      <h2>What the Insurance Industry Says</h2>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-commercial-lines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insurance Information Institute</a>, commercial liability claims have been increasing in both frequency and severity. Specialty contractors like hood cleaners face above-average claim rates due to the unique nature of their work.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.irmi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">International Risk Management Institute (IRMI)</a> specifically recommends that contractors working with fire protection systems carry specialized coverage beyond standard GL.</p>

      <h2>Real Claims That Standard GL Denied</h2>
      <p>These are examples of real claim scenarios where standard general liability policies denied coverage:</p>

      <h3>Claim #1: Storm Drain Contamination</h3>
      <p>A hood cleaning contractor pressure-washed grease that flowed into a storm drain. The city traced the contamination and issued a $45,000 fine plus cleanup costs. The contractor's GL policy denied the claim under the pollution exclusion.</p>

      <h3>Claim #2: Post-Cleaning Fire</h3>
      <p>Three weeks after a hood cleaning, a restaurant fire caused $380,000 in damage. The insurance company alleged inadequate cleaning. The contractor's GL policy denied coverage because completed operations was excluded.</p>

      <h3>Claim #3: Chemical Damage</h3>
      <p>A degreasing chemical damaged stainless steel hood panels, requiring $12,000 in replacement. The GL policy denied coverage under both the pollution exclusion and care, custody & control exclusion.</p>

      <h2>The Right Coverage for Hood Cleaning Contractors</h2>
      <p>A properly structured hood cleaning insurance program includes:</p>

    content: `
      <div class="snippet-box">
        <h2>Quick Answer: What Are the Biggest Risks for Hood Cleaners?</h2>
        <p>The top 5 risks for hood cleaning businesses are: <strong>1) Roof damage</strong> from equipment and foot traffic, <strong>2) Water damage</strong> from high-pressure washing, <strong>3) Employee injuries</strong> from slips and falls on greasy surfaces, <strong>4) Fire claims</strong> when fires occur after your cleaning, and <strong>5) Pollution liability</strong> from grease and chemical runoff. Each risk requires specific insurance coverage.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Understanding the Unique Risks of Hood Cleaning</h2>
      <p>Hood vent cleaning is one of the highest-risk specialty contractor trades. You're working on rooftops at night, using high-pressure water and chemicals, in commercial kitchens where fire risk is ever-present. Understanding these risks—and insuring them properly—is essential for business survival.</p>

      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/iif/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, specialty trade contractors have higher injury rates than many other industries. Hood cleaners face additional exposures from working at heights and in confined spaces.</p>

      <h2>Risk #1: Roof Damage</h2>

      <img src="/images/blog/rooftop-access.png" alt="Technician accessing commercial rooftop with HVAC equipment and exhaust fans via ladder" class="blog-image" />
      <p class="blog-image-caption">Accessing commercial rooftops to service exhaust fans creates significant liability exposure for membrane damage.</p>

      <p>Every time you access a rooftop to clean exhaust fans and ductwork, you're putting the building's roof at risk. Roof damage claims are among the most expensive for hood cleaning contractors.</p>

      <h3>How Roof Damage Occurs:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Foot traffic:</strong> Walking on certain roof types can crack or puncture membranes</li>
        <li><strong>Equipment placement:</strong> Heavy pressure washers or chemical containers</li>
        <li><strong>Grease degradation:</strong> Spilled grease degrades roofing materials over time</li>
        <li><strong>Water pooling:</strong> Improperly contained wash water</li>
        <li><strong>Access ladders:</strong> Damage from ladder placement</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Real Cost Examples:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Single puncture repair: $500-$2,000</li>
        <li>Section replacement: $5,000-$15,000</li>
        <li>Full roof replacement claim: $50,000-$200,000+</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Insurance Solution:</strong> Your <a href="/hood-cleaning-compliance-insurance">general liability policy</a> should specifically include coverage for rooftop access and not exclude work at heights. Some policies have roofwork exclusions—check yours carefully.</p>

      <h2>Risk #2: Water Damage</h2>

      <img src="/images/blog/water-damage.png" alt="Commercial kitchen with water damage including wet floor warning signs and damaged ceiling tiles" class="blog-image" />
      <p class="blog-image-caption">Water damage from pressure washing can affect ceiling tiles, electrical systems, and inventory—claims can exceed $50,000.</p>

      <p>High-pressure washing is essential for hood cleaning, but water goes everywhere. A single water damage claim can easily exceed $50,000.</p>

      <h3>Common Water Damage Scenarios:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Water entering electrical panels or outlets</li>
        <li>Flooding dry storage areas with inventory</li>
        <li>Water damage to ceiling tiles and drywall</li>
        <li>Damage to electronic equipment (POS systems, etc.)</li>
        <li>Water intrusion to adjacent tenant spaces</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.osha.gov/water-electrical-hazards" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OSHA guidelines on water and electrical hazards</a> outline the serious safety and liability implications of water in commercial settings.</p>

      <h3>Prevention Tips:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use proper containment around cooking equipment</li>
        <li>Cover electrical outlets and panels</li>
        <li>Protect dry storage areas with plastic sheeting</li>
        <li>Have cleanup equipment ready before starting</li>
        <li>Document existing damage before you begin</li>

      <p><strong>Insurance Solution:</strong> General liability covers water damage claims, but ensure your policy doesn't have restrictive sub-limits for water damage. <a href="/contact">Get a policy review</a> to check your coverage.</p>

      <h2>Risk #3: Employee Injuries</h2>

      <img src="/images/blog/worker-safety.png" alt="Hood cleaning technician wearing full PPE including respirator mask and safety goggles in commercial kitchen" class="blog-image" />
      <p class="blog-image-caption">Proper PPE is essential—but even with safety protocols, workers' compensation claims are common in hood cleaning.</p>

      <p>Hood cleaning is physically demanding work performed in hazardous conditions. Workers' compensation claims are common and expensive.</p>

      <h3>Most Common Injuries:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Slips and falls:</strong> Greasy rooftops and kitchen floors</li>
        <li><strong>Burns:</strong> Contact with hot equipment or chemicals</li>
        <li><strong>Respiratory issues:</strong> Inhalation of cleaning chemicals or grease vapors</li>
        <li><strong>Strains and sprains:</strong> Lifting equipment, climbing ladders</li>
        <li><strong>Ladder falls:</strong> Accessing rooftops</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Workers' Comp Cost Factors:</h3>
      <p>Hood cleaning is typically classified under <strong>NCCI code 9014</strong> or similar, which carries higher rates due to the elevated risk profile. Expect to pay $15-$30 per $100 of payroll depending on your state and claims history.</p>

      <p><strong>Insurance Solution:</strong> Workers' compensation insurance is required in most states. Work with a carrier that understands hood cleaning operations and can help implement safety programs that reduce claims and premiums.</p>

      <h2>Risk #4: Fire Claims (Completed Operations)</h2>

      <img src="/images/blog/fire-damage.png" alt="Commercial kitchen fire damage aftermath with burned hood system and charred walls" class="blog-image" />
      <p class="blog-image-caption">Kitchen fires after your service can generate liability claims exceeding $1 million.</p>

      <p>This is the existential risk for hood cleaners. If a fire occurs after your service and your work is blamed, you could face a claim exceeding $1 million.</p>

      <h3>How Fire Claims Develop:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Restaurant has a grease fire</li>
        <li>Fire department investigates cause</li>
        <li>Restaurant's insurance pays the claim</li>
        <li>Insurance company investigates who to recover from</li>
        <li>They discover you cleaned the hood system recently</li>
        <li>They allege your cleaning was inadequate</li>
        <li>Your insurance must defend you</li>
      </ol>

      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.nfpa.org/education-and-research/research/nfpa-research/fire-statistical-reports/us-fire-department-profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NFPA fire statistics</a>, commercial kitchen fires cause an average of $847,000 in property damage. When insurance companies subrogate, they come after contractors with deep pockets—or their insurance.</p>

      <p><strong>Insurance Solution:</strong> <a href="/hood-cleaning-compliance-insurance">Completed operations coverage</a> is essential. This protects you from claims arising after you've finished work. Make sure your policy has adequate completed operations limits—at least matching your per-occurrence limit.</p>

      <h2>Risk #5: Pollution Liability</h2>

      <img src="/images/blog/pollution-liability.png" alt="Storm drain with caution tape showing grease contamination in commercial parking lot" class="blog-image" />
      <p class="blog-image-caption">Grease runoff into storm drains can trigger EPA enforcement actions and cleanup costs exceeding $50,000.</p>

      <p>Standard business insurance specifically excludes pollution claims. For hood cleaners who work with grease and chemicals daily, this exclusion is catastrophic.</p>

      <h3>Pollution Scenarios for Hood Cleaners:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Grease in storm drains:</strong> Wash water carrying grease into municipal drainage</li>
        <li><strong>Chemical spills:</strong> Degreaser or cleaning solution releases</li>
        <li><strong>Air quality issues:</strong> Chemical fumes affecting building occupants</li>
        <li><strong>Soil contamination:</strong> Grease saturating parking lot or landscaping</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/clean-water-act-cwa-and-federal-facilities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EPA Clean Water Act</a> provides for significant penalties for discharge violations. Municipalities actively trace storm drain contamination back to sources.</p>

      <h3>Cost Examples:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Storm drain cleanup: $10,000-$50,000</li>
        <li>EPA/municipal fines: $25,000-$100,000+</li>
        <li>Third-party contamination claims: Varies widely</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Industry-Specific Considerations</h2>
      <p>Risk profiles vary by the types of facilities you service:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/restaurant-hood-insurance">Restaurants</a>: High fire risk, frequent service</li>
        <li><a href="/hotel-kitchen-insurance">Hotels</a>: Higher liability limits required</li>

        <li><a href="/school-kitchen-protection">Schools</a>: Additional compliance needs</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Next Steps: Get Properly Covered</h2>
      <p>If you're not sure whether your current insurance covers all five major risks, it's time for a coverage review. Many hood cleaning contractors discover gaps only after a claim is denied.</p>
